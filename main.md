# Recommender Systems
Recommender systems are a subset of information filtering systems. The aim of a recommender system is to present to the user information (such as Videos, Images, products, and etc.) that would be of immediate interest to them—this interest, for example, can be quantified by the fact that the user clicks on the video. This is largely can engineering problem as these systems have to filter millions of potential candidates into a mere dozens for the user, and ideally in less than one-second. Basic recommender systems are often categorised into the following buckets:

* **Knowledge-based**
* **Content-based**
* **Collaborative filtering**: The assumption is that if person `A` has similar opinions to person `B` on a set of issues then it is likely that person `A` will have also have similar opinion to `B` on a different issue. Hence, the name collaborative.
* **Demographic**
* **Hybrid systems**

Recommender systems are all around us. You have come across them on the popular platforms such as YouTube, Netflix, News, Instagram, and Facebook.

* Youtube [@covingtonDeepNeuralNetworks2016].  Youtube has implemented a large and sophisticated deep learning recommendation system. “However for the final determination of the effectiveness of an algorithm or model, we rely on A/B testing via live experiments”. Recommendation as extreme multi-class classification.
